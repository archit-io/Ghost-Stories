## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This web application is built using the Model View Controller(MVC) architecture. The server is built using Express.js. The database used is MongoDB. Passport.js has been used for authentication. EJS has been used as the templating engine. Bcrypt has been used to store data in an encrypted manner. The books data is fetched from the Google books API using the node-fetch library.

## Optimizations

It is planned to add multiple other features to make this app more useful to the end users:

1) Sending email for user validation.

2) Spawning and forking more threads in the Express server to support higher spike in traffic.

3) Load balancing

4) More security measures like - DDoS protection.

5) More application features like: ability to read book excerpts, interacting with other users through         personal messages and comments. 

## Lessons Learned:

This project helped me to revise the MVC concepts in a very simple and elegant manner.
